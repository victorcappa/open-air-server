# GStreamer plugins to bundle.
#
# ⚠ HOW NOT TO MAINTAIN THIS LIST: the first two blocks were captured by lsof'ing
# a live SCREEN MIRRORING session. That method looks authoritative and is not — it
# can only ever see the ONE protocol that happened to be running. AirPlay carries
# video two ways, and a mirror session never loads a single plugin of the second
# one, so the whole HLS block below was silently missing from 0.2.12 and 0.2.13:
# casting a video (YouTube & co) left the receiver looking hung. Add plugins for
# the protocol you are supporting, from the code path that uses them, and say what
# breaks without each — do not re-derive the list from a running process.
PLUGINS=(
  # SCREEN MIRRORING (raop_rtp_mirror -> h264/h265 -> our avlayer appsink sink)
  # + the audio path. Verified in the field.
  app applemedia audioconvert audioresample autodetect coreelements
  level libav videoconvertscale videofilter videoparsersbad volume
  osxaudio typefindfunctions audioparsers playback

  # AirPlay VIDEO PROTOCOL (on_video_play -> playbin3 on an m3u8, uxplay -hls).
  # None of these are reachable from a mirror session; all four are required, and
  # the failure modes are ugly (silent hang, or an error only g_print'd to
  # engine.log). Measured against Apple's reference HLS streams, in this bundle:
  #   adaptivedemux2  hlsdemux2 (rank 257 -- beats the legacy `hls` plugin's
  #                   hlsdemux at 256, which is why `hls` is NOT here; it also
  #                   carries dashdemux2/mssdemux2, so `dash` is not either).
  #                   Without it: "urisourcebin: your GStreamer installation is
  #                   missing a plug-in", nothing plays.
  #   soup            souphttpsrc (rank 256; `curl`'s curlhttpsrc is 128 and would
  #                   never be picked, so `curl` is dead weight). Serves BOTH the
  #                   engine's own http://localhost/master.m3u8 and the CDN
  #                   segments. Without it: "No URI handler implemented for http".
  #                   NB the plugin does not LINK libsoup, it dlopens it by leaf
  #                   name -- see the hand-seeded files in step 3.
  #   mpegtsdemux     tsdemux, for HLS whose segments are MPEG-TS. Without it:
  #                   "decodebin3 ... missing a plug-in".
  #   isomp4          qtdemux, for HLS whose segments are fMP4/CMAF. Both
  #                   containers occur in the wild; without it that half of the
  #                   senders get "Missing element: Quicktime demuxer".
  # NOT here on purpose: `subparse`/`pango`. A master playlist advertising WebVTT
  # subtitles used to hang playbin at "buffering 0%" forever; the fix is one line
  # in the fork (video_renderer.c clears GST_PLAY_FLAG_TEXT -- a receiver has no
  # subtitle UI), which costs 0 MB instead of pango's ~13 MB font stack.
